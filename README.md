# CortexMod
 BigVirusBoi's test mod for Kody Simpson

## Notes:
 1. If you don't get runClient as a run configuration, run "genIntellijRuns" with Gradle
 2. If you get a StringIndexOutOfBoundsException when running runClient, delete the client-extra.jar, found under external libraries and refresh your Gradle
 3. **USE JAVA 16!!!**
